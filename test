                        Hello! I’m Bouchra, a Full Stack Web Development student at 1337 Coding School (UM6P) with a strong interest in building clean, responsive, and user-friendly web applications. I focus primarily on the front end, using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, and I enjoy developing interfaces from scratch without relying on frameworks.
                    
                        While my main strength lies in front-end development, I’m also comfortable working on back-end logic to ensure smooth communication between the client and server sides. I take pride in writing clear, efficient code and learning best practices along the way.
                    
                        I’m currently looking for an internship opportunity where I can apply and grow my skills in a real-world environment, collaborate with experienced developers, and contribute to meaningful projects.
                    
                        Outside of coding, I enjoy staying active and exploring creative ideas that keep me motivated and curious.
